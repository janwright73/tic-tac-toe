# tic-tac-toe
This project is a tic-tac-toe game.  The application has two players, X and O.  Each player takes a turn trying to get three symbols in a row.

This project demonstrates the following concepts: 
- use of React state and useEffect
- React parent/child relationships


I had fun learning how to use React to build a simple game.

### How to Run
Anyone can run this file by downloading the repository, running a local file server like node http-server


### Future Improvements
I would like to add two features to this application.  

1) I would like to add a 'reset game' function to this application.  I would do this by adding another button with a callback function that would reset the board and squares in the board. 

2) I would like to add an auto-play feature where the program plays against you.  This way you don't have to beat yourself by playing both players to simulate a game.  I would impliment this by having the program pick random squares for the second player's turn.
